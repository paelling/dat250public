# DAT250: Programming Assignment 3
## EJBs, SOAP and JMS

In this assignment you are required to implement the domain model for the auction application developed as part of the high-level design in assignment 1. This assignment is the first step towards implementing a full auctioning application using Java EE.

You must use the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) to define the entity classes required in order to store information about auctions in a database. In addition, you must implement a RESTful API using JAX-RS that exposes part of the application as web services.

You can start the development by either setting up a new Java EE project in Eclipse as explained in the project setup tutorial or you can adapt the existing advanced tweet application which includes most of the Java EE frameworks that you will also need for the auctioning application.

## Part 1 - EJBs

Implement the classes, attributes, and relations from your auction domain model in Java. Use JPA to define the entity classes required in order to store information about auctions, bids, products, etc. in a database. The information stored in the database must also capture the relations (associations) between the classes. As part of the this, you also have to define the persistence unit for your application.

Persistence units and object-relational mapping (ORM) are explained in Chapters 4 and 5 of the Java EE book.

After having deployed the application on the application server you should inspect the database and check that the correct tables have been generated by JPA.

## Part 2 - SOAP

In order to test the implementation of the RESTful web services in Part 3, you should populate your database with some test data.

This can be done either by writing an SQL script to the load the data (see Page 120 in the Java EE book) or using a single Enterprise Java Bean executed at startup to programmatically persist data into the database (see the slides from the lecture on Friday 7/9).

## Part 3 - JMS

You are required to use the JAX-RS API to implement RESTful web services which make it possible to access the auction application using HTTP.

Implementation of RESTful web services using Java EE is explained in Chapter 15 of the Java EE book.

The following web services should at least be supported:

    GET <app-path>/rest/auctions - which should return a representation with references to all current auctions (ongoing/completed) in the system.
    GET <app-path>/res/auctions/{id} - which should return a representation of the auction identified by id
    GET <app-path>/res/auctions/{id}/bids/ - which should return a representation with reference to all current bids in the auction identified by id
    GET <app-path>/res/auctions/{aid}/bids/{bid} - which should return a representation of the given bid within the auction identified by aid
    POST <app-path>/res/auction/{id}/bids - which creates a bid with a specified amount in the auction identified by id and returns a representation of the bid. The amount should be contained in the payload of the request (or optionally as a query parameter).

The RESTful web services are required to support both XML and JSON formats as representation of resources. The underlying business methods that provide the services can be implemented using stateless enterprise beans. In addition, you need to use an entity manager to persist and retrieve data from the database.

Test the RESTful services by running HTTP requests against them and inspecting the results. For testing you may use

    A web browser
    A Java program implemented using the JAX-RS Client API.
    Curl
    Postman

Part 4 - Setup Connection to PostgreSQL database server

Until now you have used the local Derby database server on your PC for the persistent data of your application. For the auction assignment you will use a PostgreSQL database server that has been setup as HVL.

Go through the instructions for PostgreSQL configuration. Your group will need a username and password from the instructor (Alex or Fernando).

Test that your application correctly stores data in the PostgreSQL database.
